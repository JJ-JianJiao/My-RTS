# RTS Demo - Toy Soldiers
 My first RTS game. The player needs to control the toy soldiers to defeat the red dragon. At the beginning of the game, a guide can help players familiarize the operation. Players can use the keyboard to move the camera or move the mouse to the edge of the screen to move the camera. Players can select soldiers with the left button or hold Shift while dragging the left mouse button to select soldiers in batches. The right button is used to move or attack. The red dragon has AI. The vision distance of the red dragon when sleeping is smaller than when it is awake. When the dragon is too far away from the nest, the dragon will fly back to the nest. Defeating the dragon is difficult and requires players to operate soldiers. For demonstration, the option of "Weak Dragon" has been added
